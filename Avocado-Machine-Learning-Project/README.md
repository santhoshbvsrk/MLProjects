This is a Regression Machine Learning project on Avocado Dataset where we've performed EDA, Regression & Model Evaluation Metrics.
Regression is performed using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor & KNN Regressor algorithms.
As part of Model Evaluation Metrics, I've used MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Square Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), R^2 Error (R Square Error).
Based on the above Model Evaluatoin Metrics, we've choosen a ML model which is best for predicting the price of Avocado.
